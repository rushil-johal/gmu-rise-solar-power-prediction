# Predicting Photovoltaic Power from Solar Irradiance using Supervised Machine Learning Models

This repository contains my full research project as part of the **RISE Scholars Program** at **George Mason University's College of Science**. The study investigates, models, and forecasts photovoltaic (PV) solar power generation using real-world 5-minute and 30-minute interval data from a solar energy system.
  
**Affiliation:** George Mason University - Department of Computational and Data Sciences

## Objective

With climate change accelerating the global shift toward renewable energy, accurate prediction and forecasting of solar power output is crucial for optimizing grid stability and energy efficiency.

This project focuses on:
- Cleaning and transforming real-world solar energy production data
- Performing detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building predictive regression models for near-term solar output
- Designing and evaluating time series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet)
